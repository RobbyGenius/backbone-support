lib
-----------------------------
- add support for enyo.Ajax based Backbone.sync mechanism so jQuery is not necessary out of the box

enyo.ModelController
-----------------------------
- add support for computed properties automatically being notified when an individual model attribute changes
- break out the update events so that handling of particular events can be overloaded by subclasses
